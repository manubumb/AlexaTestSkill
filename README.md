# AlexaTestSkill

This was the first skill I played around with.  Started from an alexa course on pluralsight, then I modified it to have a little fun, adding custom responses to questions, and eventually having alexa sing happy birthday to a friend.

This has examples of using sound clips from amazon's sound library, adding pauses, and controlling the excitement level of the speech.
